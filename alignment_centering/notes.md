# About alignment and centering

## 1] With `justify-content`

Starting with our basic html and CSS files, we have the following:

![flexbox1](start.png)

Now, let's start to play with the CSS by adding a `justify-content` property to the `.container` class:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  border: 10px solid goldenrod;
}
```

(I added a border to the container so we can see where it is)

What does `justify-content` do? It aligns the flex items along the main axis which is, by default, horizontally from left to right. Here with `justify-content: center;` we are telling the flex items to be centered along the main axis, giving us the following:

![flexbox2](justify_content_demo_center.png)

The other values that can be used for `justify-content` are: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`. The following link has a great visual demo of each of these values: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-justify-content.

## 2] With `align-items`

`align-items` behaves very similarly to `justify-content`. It aligns the flex items along the cross axis which is, by default, vertically from top to bottom. Like we did above with `justify-content`, let's add `align-items: center;` to the `.container` class of our CSS file:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  border: 10px solid goldenrod;
}
```

(I added a height to the container so that there is enough room for the flex items and let us see the alignment)

This gives us the following:

As pointed out in Wes Bos' video, the coolest looking value for `align-items` is `baseline`, which makes sure that the all the text in the flex items are on the same baseline. If we do the the following:

```css

.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  border: 10px solid goldenrod;
}

.box1 {
  font-size: 10px;
}

.box2 {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.box3 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

.box4 {
  font-size: 40px;
}

.box5 {
  font-size: 50px;
}

.box6 {
  font-size: 60px;
}

.box7 {
  font-size: 70px;
}

.box8 {
  font-size: 50px;
}

.box9 {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.box10 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

We get:

Very cool in my opinion!

## 3] With `align-content`

According to https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/, `align-content` *"aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis."*. Let's see what it does with the following CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
  border: 10px solid goldenrod;
}
```

![flexbox5](align_content_demo_wrong.png)

Having `align-content: center;` here does not make any difference to not having it. In order to see what it does, we need to follow what the documentation says: *"This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where flex-wrap is set to either wrap or wrap-reverse). A single-line flexible container (i.e. where flex-wrap is set to its default value, no-wrap) will not reflect align-content."*. So let's change our CSS to the following:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  height: 100vh;
  border: 10px solid goldenrod;
}

.box {
  width: 33.333%;
}
```

This now gives:

![flexbox6](align_content_demo_better.png)

What we are basically doing here is vertically centering items within a layout with multiple rows.

## 3] With `align-self`

Finally, we have `align-self` that can be used to align individual flex items, here one of the boxes in our flex container. Let's see it for ourselves with the following:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
  border: 10px solid goldenrod;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.box {
  width: 33.333%;
}

.box3 {
  padding-bottom: 200px;
  align-self: flex-end;
}

.box7 {
  padding-right: 200px;
  align-self: center;
}
```

giving us:

Nothing much to add here as it is pretty self-explanatory.
